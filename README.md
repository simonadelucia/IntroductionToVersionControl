# iOS Clock App (Timer Feature)

A SwiftUI project that recreates the functionality and user interface of the native iOS Clock application's Timer tab. This project focuses on coding SwiftUI layouts, custom components, and state management.

## Features Implemented

* **Custom Timer Picker:** A  functional time picker (Hours, Minutes, Seconds) using the `.wheel` style.
* **Start/Cancel Controls:** Circular buttons for starting and resetting the timer.
* **Native UI:** Implemented using `Form` for the "Label" and "When Timer Ends" sections to match the iOS native appearance.
* **Modal Presentation:** The "When Timer Ends" sound selection opens as a modal sheet, replicating the native iOS behavior.
* **TabBar Navigation:** Setup using `TabView` to organize the application into four main sections: World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch, and Timer.
* **Custom Accent Color:** Uses the native iOS orange accent color for the selected tab icon.

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** Swift
* **Framework:** SwiftUI
* **Platform:** iOS
